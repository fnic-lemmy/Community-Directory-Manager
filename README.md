# Community-Directory-Manager
This is the directory for a cmd script containing a toolset for managing the community directory on lemmy. (Currently in works and the script will be ChatGPT gen'd.)

For now I will use the page for tracking the tasks and the script will be uploaded after getting the foundations down.
